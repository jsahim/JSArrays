# Arrays Self-Evaluation
1. How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
    - With what I have been presented so far, I would say that I am at a 4 on a comfort scale.
1. Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
    - The Methods and how they interact with variables is something that I might want more clarification on as well as visuals.
1. What questions do you have about Arrays?
    - What is the practical purpose for the POP method?
    - What does "call" actually mean? (this is somewhat nebulous for me right now)
